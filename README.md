# Protest Maps
Protest Maps is a website created during the Duckhacks for Social Good hackathon to help promote, support, and educate on progressive movements.  

The website allows people to easily locate and attend protests happening near them while ensuring their safety by allowing users to report violence/police violence happening nearby. 

Moreover, by offering information on specific organizations and causes as well as many meaningful resources to help support them, Protest Maps invites everyone to take part in the action and effect positive change.
